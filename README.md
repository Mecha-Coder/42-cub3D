### **Overview**

A pseudo-3D game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.

### **About**

👉 [**Project requirement**](\demo\en.subject.pdf)


A game engine manages the game state, handles keyboard and mouse input, and renders the game scene.
All of these systems are implemented in this project.

What’s interesting is that the “3D” world here isn’t truly 3D.
It’s actually a 2D game that uses the raycasting technique to simulate a 3D environment.

Raycasting relies on the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm - trigonometry we used during our school-day, plane projection concepts, and a few assumptions about the 3D world — to render the scene.

Once the 3D walls are rendered, they look flat and dull. To bring them to life, we use texture mapping to paint the walls with detailed textures. 

This project also includes a minimap and sprite animations, including door open/close mechanics for added interactivity

### **How to run**

System requirement: **Debian/Ubuntu/WSL2**


```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxext-dev libbsd-dev libxrandr-dev libxfixes-dev

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mecha-Coder/42-cub3D
